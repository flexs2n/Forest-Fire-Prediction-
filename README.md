# Forest-Fire-Prediction-

This project is an implementation of classification using Logistic Regression and Neural Network Classifier.

# Requirements
The following packages are required to run the code:

scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
tensorflow
keras
You can install these packages using pip.

# Data
The project uses the "iris" dataset from scikit-learn, which contains 150 instances of iris flowers, with four features each. The target variable is the type of flower, with three possible values.

# Usage
To run the code, open the "linear_classification.ipynb" notebook and execute the cells. The notebook contains two sections:

**Logistic Regression**: This section implements logistic regression for linear classification and reports the accuracy score.

**Neural Network Classifier**: This section implements a neural network classifier using Keras and reports the accuracy score.

# Results
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 33.33% on the test set, while the neural network classifier achieved an accuracy of 83.33% on the same dataset.

# Conclusion
The neural network classifier outperformed logistic regression in terms of accuracy, highlighting the usefulness of deep learning for classification tasks and the neural network has higher levels of randomness.
