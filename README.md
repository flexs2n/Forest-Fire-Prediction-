# Requirements
The following packages are required to run the code:

scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
tensorflow

You can install these packages using pip.

# Usage
To run the code, open the "Forest-Fire_prediction.ipynb" notebook and execute the cells. The notebook contains two sections:

**Linear Regression**: This section implements logistic regression for linear classification and reports the accuracy score.

**Neural Network Classifier**: This section implements a neural network classifier using Keras and reports the accuracy score.

# Results
The linear regression model achieved an accuracy of 33.33% on the test set, while the neural network classifier achieved an accuracy of 83.33% on the same dataset.

# Conclusion
The neural network classifier outperformed logistic regression in terms of accuracy, highlighting the usefulness of deep learning for classification tasks and the neural network has higher levels of randomness.
